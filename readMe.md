# King Oyster 
## Bot logs
Code logs are important things among developers. Since I'm not using github within my workspace this time around (bc I don't need it for hosting and I'm lazy), I'll be outlining the different versions of the bot with all changes made along the way here.

###  v0.1.05 
- üêõ **Bug:** Bot doesn't reply to messages send in replies to others
- üìö **Libraries:** Google authentication renewal
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Bot reacts to keywords, `@ everyone` messages (based on channel), attachments (also based on channel), and etc. 
- ‚ú® **Feature:** King oyster can now detect haikus (not perfect with syllable counting‚Ä¶ it's just a bot afterall ;-; ). Just type a haiku and it'll jump at you if it detects it.

###  v0.1.06:
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Syllable counter (count syllables for any poem when prompted), to try out reply to a message and say `@King Oyster#0093 count syllables`
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Generate QR code, to try out use slash command or type `qr https://example.com SCALE COLOR-HEX BG-COLOR-HEX` (you can leave anything after the link out of it if you want to)
- ‚ùå ~~**Feature:** Add new creative resources to King Oyster~~ ***Bad Idea*** ‚ùå (would need constant updates)
- ‚ú® **Feature *Update:*** Improve the inspirator, figured there's no use for the adverb in there. Use through `/inspire` command or type `@King Oyster#0093 give me some inspiration` (keywords: `inspire`, `inspiration`)

### v0.1.07
- üé© **Hosting:** Improve memory & hosting
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Allow bot to welcome new members
- üöî **Modding:** Spam prevention features with bot. If the same user sends 10+ messages in the same minute, or sends a message that is detected as spam (15+ letters without a space will be detected as spam, ex: uhfkeskfksfnnksefnks), mute them for a minute. If they spam again, bot will mute again for double the time. Mute info will reset after every hour (meaning if they spam again the next hour, it'll be back to 1 minute mute and goes up from there)
- ‚ú® **Feature:** Creating reminders. Ask Oyster to remind you to do something at certain time, and it'll DM you or send a message inside the channel when the time comes.
- üîß **Improvement:** Allowed bot to notice poems in **share channel** (used to only react to posts with embeds)
- üîß **Improvement:** Allow user to view specific or next quote (extra parameter), and make it so that requesting new quote creates a new message rather than editing previous message (this is how it was at first but then I edited it to prevent spam and now I'm putting it back after watching recent user interactions)

# Slash Commands
Slash commands are a list of pre-defined commands that can be used to interact with the bot. <br> 
These commands can also come with different input parameters accordingly (see [src/register-commands.js](#src-register-commandsjs)).<br>

To start using commands, all you need to do is start typing a message with the character `/`, then you can select the command you wish to use.
<br><img width="795" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aea8cd47-814b-452c-a80d-1ffdc8fb9291" />

The purpose of each command is listed below.

___
## <kbd>`/report` <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> <kbd>REASON</kbd> <kbd>ATTACHMENTS (optional)</kbd> </kbd>
Report <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> for <kbd>REASON</kbd>, and optionally attach <kbd>ATTACHMENTS</kbd> as proof.
<br>If the <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> (being reported) is an **officer**, then the bot will let the user know that they might've made a mistake.

<br><img width="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16c13543-8bfa-49e6-98af-bc6e38d1a542" />

<br>Despite this, the report is _still send._ When a report is send, the bot will search for a channel with the name `bot-reports`. If this channel doesn't exist, the bot is smart enough to create it, while restricting access to it by regular members (allowing only officers to view it).
<br>The report will include the <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> display name and user ID, along with the user's username, their <kbd>REASON</kbd>, and an <kbd>ATTACHMENT</kbd> if provided.

<br>In the case that the user (sending the report) was an officer, then the <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> will be automatically muted for **10 minutes** after the report is send.

___
## <kbd>`/add-officer` <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> </kbd>
Command to give the officer role to a member. User must be an officer to be able to use this command.
<br>‚úÖ If the user is an officer, then <kbd>USERNAME</kbd> will be assigned an officer role. 
<br>‚ùå If the user is NOT an officer, they will be notified that only officers are able to run this command.

___
## <kbd>`/deadline` </kbd>
This command will inform the user of the C&K magazine submissions deadline, along with a countdown.
<br>Button interactions can lead user to [submission requirements](#requirements-), or the submissions form.

<br><img width="789" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30d5814a-7abb-4e22-8bc0-a0ecbf9eb721" />

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>deadline</kbd> or <kbd>submission</kbd> AND EITHER <kbd>time</kbd> OR <kbd>when</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/requirements` </kbd>
This command will inform the user of the C&K magazine submissions' requirements.
<br>Button interactions can lead user to [deadline](#deadline-), or the submissions form.

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>submission</kbd> or <kbd>requirements</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/submit` <kbd>TITLE</kbd> <kbd>AUTHOR</kbd> <kbd>TYPE</kbd> <kbd>INFO</kbd> <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> <kbd>LINK (optional)</kbd> </kbd>
Submit a piece to the magazine.
<br>The <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> file will be sent to Google drive, along with other submissions (see TODO link drive section).
<br>Before being send into the drive, the submission will be sorted into different folders based on the chosen <kbd>TYPE</kbd>:
1. Writing
2. Visual
3. Video
4. Audio
5. Other

The <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> file will also be renamed into the title of the piece, followed by an underscore and the default file name.
<br>Nevertheless, in case our bot faces issues submitting the piece to the drive, and as a backup, Oyster automatically sends all submissions in a separate, private channel, called "bot-submissions." This will include the user's username, the piece's <kbd>TITLE</kbd> and <kbd>AUTHOR</kbd> (name published under), all hidden behind spoilers, along with the submission <kbd>TYPE</kbd>, extra <kbd>INFO</kbd>, a <kbd>LINK</kbd> if included, and obviously the <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> if attached.

It's unlikely that the bot would ever have issues with uploading the <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd>, unless if the <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> is very large in size. To prevent issues, we stop the bot from sending an attachment of the <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> in the **bot-submissions** channel if it's _**over 200 MB in size!**_ The bot would still attempt to upload the file to google drive, in which it should succeed but at a slower rate. This is a rare case in which we'd advise to use the <kbd>LINK</kbd> option to share your piece (and for <kbd>SUBMISSION</kbd> you can submit a simple thumbnail).

<sup>**Note:** If the **bot-submissions** channel doesn't exist, the bot is smart enough to create it and set permissions accordingly.</sup>

___
## <kbd>`/schedule` </kbd>
This command will inform the user of the meeting time and location of our regular C&K member meetings, along with the exact meeting time of the next meeting.

<br> > üêõ TODO fix bug with time (hosting service & discord have different timezones which SUCKS btw bc I spend hours trying to fix this for the deadline and just now realized it's the same issue for this)

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>schedule</kbd> or <kbd>meet</kbd> AND <kbd>time</kbd> or <kbd>when</kbd> or <kbd>where</kbd> 
   
___
## <kbd>`/officehours` </kbd>
Get the location and time of our office hours for the semester.
<br>This command connects to a Google spreadsheet, where officers can input their office hours times without needing to touch the code.
<br>Same case for infortmation included in the [deadline](#deadline-) and [schedule](#schedule-) commands.

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>officehours</kbd> or <kbd>office hours</kbd> or <kbd>office-hours</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/appointment` <kbd>MONTH</kbd> <kbd>DATE</kbd> <kbd>HOUR</kbd> <kbd>DESCRIPTION</kbd> </kbd>
Set an appointment to meet with an officer in <kbd>MONTH</kbd>, <kbd>DATE</kbd>, at <kbd>HOUR</kbd>. The appointment is then treated as a report, and will be send to the reports channel for an officer to check (see `/REPORT ...` command). Along with the user info and appointment time, the report will also include the <kbd>DESCRIPTION</kbd>. As a matter of fact, the bot response send privately to the user is identical to the report the officers recieve (see image below).

<br><img width="816" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59d2295c-26e3-4485-a2a3-5e9efd792eb7" />


___
## <kbd>`/rules` </kbd>
Command will help the user find the server rules. 
<br>The bot will also give the user the option to navigate to the [Discord Guidelines]([url](https://discord.com/guidelines)) or view [MCC Policies]([url](https://www.monroecc.edu/depts/policy/)) with the click of a button.

<br><img width="651" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac8424e-3ecc-405f-a791-b3ccb5b9bf81" />

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>rules</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/linkperm` <kbd>LINK</kbd> </kbd>
Request permission to post links.
<br>This will send a report to the same **bot-report** channel used by the `/report...` and `/appointment...` commands.
<br>The request will look as follows:

<br><img width="812" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88226795-59b4-44fb-97bf-2a36932901ed" />

<br>To accept, after reviewing the link, a mod, aka officer, can give the user a __**@link perm**__ role. 
<br>This role will allow the user to post links without being stopped by the bot.

<br>Please note that certain links, such as youtube and tenor urls (GIFs) are allowed without needing link perms (see `allowedLinks` array in code).

___
## <kbd>`/suggest` <kbd>ACTIVITY</kbd> <kbd>INFO</kbd> </kbd>
Suggest an <kbd>ACTIVITY</kbd> for us to do during our weekly member meetings, along with extra <kbd>INFO</kbd> on how the activity works.
<br>Similar to `report...`, `/appointment ...`, and `/linkperm ...` commands, this command will send the suggestion as a report in the **bot-reports** channel in the format shown below.

<br><img width="817" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ce1105-07a8-4d46-994f-d844714adaec" />


## <kbd>`/roll` <kbd>MAX (optional)</kbd> </kbd>
Roll a dice and get a random number. Optionally, you can adjust the range of possible values from the roll by adjusting the <kbd>MAX</kbd> sides of the die.

<br><img width="661" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0dc9e37-6766-4b1f-bc5d-065ec48004bc" />


___
## <kbd>`/inspire` </kbd>
Get a random adjective and noun to help spark some inspiration ‚ú®
<br>Don't like what you see? With the click of a button you can spin the wheel once again.

<br><img width="309" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473ea3be-864d-4848-b169-85113b43c9ca" />

<sup>**Note:** See `getRandomInspiration(...)` function in code, `noun` and `adjective` variables.</sup>

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>inspire</kbd> or <kbd>inspiration</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/quote` </kbd>
Wanna feel some wisdom? Then get a random quote from a set of 40+ pre-selected quotes (saved in [quotes.txt](TODO link quotes.txt) file).
<br>Don't like what you see? Worry not you ungrateful child, for I have an <kbd>Another Quote</kbd> only for you.

<br><img width="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ba96f4e-b587-4911-97e8-06c7003940c2" />

> Can be activated through chat messages by replying to or mentioning `@King Oyster#0093`, using keywords: 
> <br><kbd>quote</kbd>

___
## <kbd>`/qr-code` <kbd>URL</kbd> <kbd>SCALE (optional)</kbd> <kbd>COLOR (optional)</kbd> <kbd>COLOR-BG (optional)</kbd> </kbd>
Have Oyster generate you a QR code that redirects to <kbd>URL</kbd>, along with a few optional inputs, such as <kbd>SCALE</kbd> of the QR code image (default: 20), and the <kbd>COLOR</kbd> of the QR code (HEX code recommended), and <kbd>COLOR-BG</kbd> for the QR code background (transparent by default). 

<br>See image below for an example of how QR code can be generated WITHOUT using the slash command, but rather by sending a text message.

<br><img width="496" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88cd37bb-86d2-4278-a34d-38d2ee4cc9c5" />

<sup>**Note:** In the image above, I could've also included the <kbd>COLOR-BG</kbd> at the end, but chose not to so the background defaulted to transparent. </sup>

The slash command works the same way as the text command, except if you generate a QR code with the slash commands, the message is hidden and can only be viewed by you.

> Can be activated through chat messages by sending a message that
> <br>STARTS WITH <kbd>`qr `</kbd>

___
## Non-Slash Commands
To make the bot feel more lively and noticed, we need it to react and interact with the community without being tasked to.
<br>For this reason, I have added a set of interactions for the bot. Some of these interactions might still be considered commands, but most could happen unexpectedly.

## Haiku Detection
King Oyster automatically checks all send messages in search of a 5-7-5 syllables haiku pattern. If it finds a message that meets this critera, it'll reply with the following message:

<img width="313" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91232b0b-c548-45a7-a02a-ee32331e8ae0" />

> <sup>**Note:** You don't need to send a massage with multiple lines for Oyster to find the haiku

<br>Of course, the syllable counter method by King Oyster isn't perfect since it's only a bot. For us humans, it's as simple as counting how many times our chin drops when saying a word, but for a bot‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it's more difficult to program the logic for that, so expect some flaws here and there. I'd say it's close to accurate but not fully there yet.

## Count Syllables
When asked to, King Oyster will count the syllables inside of a poem.
<br>See image below for usage.

<br><img width="800" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7b37c9a-d2b8-476f-8641-655ea2d98572" />

> **Keywords:** <kbd>count</kbd> AND <kbd>syllables</kbd>

## Reactions
I was considering making a whole new section for this part but figured might as well keep it a part of this. 
<br>King Oyster will react to different messages based on keywords, name of the channel they're send, mentions, and such.

For example, if you say **"important"** in your message then king oyster will try to emphasize your message
<img width="489" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88085403-142d-4fa3-9141-e847f7b78bfc" />

Personally, I would advise against reading the rest of this section, as knowing when and what Oyster reacts to would ruin the magic, but I won't stop you if you're curious.
