# TO UPDATE SIMPLE INFO
To make this bot easier to edit for other officers in C&K, I connected it to this spreadsheet:
<br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ppkEjOB4EYGmxIexfEBU_mMoCqp8vWpwRIgj6Cr9zjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0

<br>You can also find the spreadsheet on the Drive, along with the submission files separated into different folders.

# TO UPDATE FOLDER FOR SUBMISSIONS
You must edit the .env file if you'd like to change the location of the submissions to another folder.

<br>You'll need to change the value for these folders:
<br>    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_1
<br>    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_2
<br>    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_3
<br>    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_4
<br>    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_5

<br>Each of these variables is set to the folder ID for the literature, visual, audio, video, and other folder.
<br>You can set them to a different folder by going to google drive, go inside the folder you want to use, and 
look at the page link when you're inside that folder. Here's an example:

<br>https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1brB1739baRuSjRnlbRYFkuhvy58AIiWh

<br>When you look at the link, everything after the "folders/" is the folder ID. 
<br>For this example it's: 1brB1739baRuSjRnlbRYFkuhvy58AIiWh
<br>Take this code, copy it and paste it in place of the other folder IDs in the .env, and there you have it. 
<br>It's that simple.
<br>Still feel free to contact me if it seems complicated.
