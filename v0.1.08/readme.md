# TO UPDATE SIMPLE INFO
To make this bot easier to edit for other officers in C&K, I connected it to a private google spreadsheet (accessible by C&K officers only) 

You can also find the spreadsheet on the Drive, along with the submission files separated into different folders.

# TO UPDATE FOLDER FOR SUBMISSIONS
You must edit the .env file if you'd like to change the location of the submissions to another folder.

You'll need to change the value for these folders:
    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_1
    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_2
    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_3
    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_4
    DRIVE_FOLDER_ID_5

Each of these variables is set to the folder ID for the literature, visual, audio, video, and other folder.
You can set them to a different folder by going to google drive, go inside the folder you want to use, and 
look at the page link when you're inside that folder. 

When you look at the link, everything after the "folders/" is the folder ID. 

Take this code, copy it and paste it in place of the other folder IDs in the .env, and there you have it. 
It's that simple.
Still feel free to contact me if it seems complicated.
